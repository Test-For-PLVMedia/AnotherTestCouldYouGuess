Cable Maintenance
-----------------

### Re-Ending SDI

\[TODO:\]

### Re-Ending Ethernet (CAT5/CAT6)

Our process isn’t the exact same, but you can follow [this tutorial](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/RSUazDcLVWo?t%3D34&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1650574201200471&usg=AOvVaw2WUC4pMIfT8pTQ5CjOymy8) to get the gist.

Cable Types

#### XLR

### Camera Power Cables

\[TODO:\]

### Other Power Cables

#### Monitor Power

Technically called a C13 cord, but nobody ever calls it that.

Sometimes it’ll get called “wall power” or something similar, too.![](images/image79.png)

### Data Cables

#### USB Types

The primary USB connector types are below. There is also a designation between versions, such as USB 3.0 connectors being colored blue on the inside, but for the most part this

difference does not affect us - if it does, just look for the blue USB 3.0.![](images/image85.png)

### Network Cables

#### Ethernet (CAT5 and CAT6)

For our purposes, there’s almost never a real difference between CAT5 and CAT6. They’re interoperable and have the same connector.

The difference is just max-rated speed and power, due to some cable internals. Effectively, don’t worry about it.

Converting Guide to Website
===========================

This section is primarily for Hoch alone, as an easily-referenceable checklist.

*   Go to a private browser in chrome, and open the [google doc version](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3axjmcomf4MPFOvocp7oQNN6MqDjOxp8AQeGiddw8k/edit%23&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1650574201268485&usg=AOvVaw2dmySLHV5tsQ5Lm8XbgMY1) of the manual.
*   In google docs itself (not the chrome top bar), go File -> Download -> Web Page (.html, zipped)
*   Open [ethanharv.github.io/GDToJekyll](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ethanharv.github.io/GDToJekyll&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1650574201269102&usg=AOvVaw3Z5HSpbGeHC0Wh6256PbZs)
*   Do NOT unzip the file, just upload it directly as a zip and click “Process”
*   Go to the PLV Media Guide folder (in documents on your computer), and delete everything EXCEPT \_config.yml and CNAME
*   Once the processed file is downloaded, put its unzipped contents into the folder.
*   Open github desktop. Commit the changes to main.
*   Remember to also click “push origin.”
*   Done! It should update in ~2 minutes.
